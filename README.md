### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer from Mexico, who loves UX/UI design, and currently working on my portfolio. 
I mainly develop in HTML, CSS, in 2022 I fell in love with Javascript, React, Tailwind. I'm always learning. 
I'm also currently working on a couple of projects for my portfolio, including my own website. I'm also contributing to a school project, which is a site to adopt animals in Mexico City. :heartbeat:
