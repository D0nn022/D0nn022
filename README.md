### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer from Mexico, who loves UX/UI design, and I currently work as a freelancer. I mainly develop in HTML, in 2022 I fell in love with CSS & Javascript. I'm always learning. I'm currently working on a couple of projects for my portfolio, including my own website. I'm also collaborating on a school project, which is a site to adopt animals in Mexico City. ðŸ’“
